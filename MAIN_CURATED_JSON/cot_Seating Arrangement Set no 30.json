    "explanation": "P is at position 3, Q at position 5. R is at an extreme end, so position 1 or 6. R could be at position 1.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: P is at position 3, Q is second to the right of P, meaning position 5. Step 2: R is at an extreme end, so position 1 or 6. Step 3: Testing if R can be at position 1. Step 4: No conflicts with other constraints. Step 5: R at position 1 is valid.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "With A to the left of B, C opposite D, and E between A and D, the circular arrangement forces B to be to the right of C.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Given A is to the left of B, C is opposite D, and E is between A and D. Step 2: Need to find who is to the right of C. Step 3: In a 5-person circle, opposite means two to three positions apart. Step 4: Placing all constraints, B must be adjacent to C. Step 5: B is to the right of C verified.",

Step 3: If the parent has only one son and Priya exists, Priya could be the daughter or the man could be Priya if male. Step 4: Since Priya is pointing to the man, they are different people.
