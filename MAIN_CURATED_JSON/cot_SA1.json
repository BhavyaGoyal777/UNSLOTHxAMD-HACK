    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "With A left of B, C opposite D, and E between A and D, the circular arrangement forces B to be right of C.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Given A left of B, C opposite D, E between A and D. Step 2: Need to find who is right of C. Step 3: In 5-person circle, opposite means 2-3 positions apart. Step 4: Placing all constraints, B must be adjacent to C. Step 5: B is right of C verified.",

    "reasoning": "Step 1: P at position 3, Q second to right means position 5. Step 2: R at extreme means position 1 or 6. Step 3: Test if R can be at position 1. Step 4: No conflicts with other constraints. Step 5: R at position 1 is valid.",
