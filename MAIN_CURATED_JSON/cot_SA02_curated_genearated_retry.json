    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Given A is left of B, C opposite D, and E between A and D, the arrangement places B to the right of C.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: A is left of B. Step 2: C is opposite D. Step 3: E is between A and D. Step 4: In a circle of five, opposite means two seats apart. Step 5: B must be adjacent to C on the right.",
