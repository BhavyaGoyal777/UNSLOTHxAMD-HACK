    "reasoning": "Step 1: P is at position 3. Step 2: Q sits second to the right of P, so Q is at position 5. Step 3: R sits at an extreme end, which could be position 1 or 6. Step 4: Testing R at position 1 does not conflict with other constraints. Step 5: Therefore, R could be at position 1.",

    "explanation": "With A to the left of B, C opposite D, and E between A and D, the circular arrangement forces B to be to the right of C.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: A is to the left of B. Step 2: C is opposite D. Step 3: E is between A and D. Step 4: In a 5-person circle, opposite means two to three positions apart. Step 5: Placing all constraints, B must be adjacent to C, making B to the right of C.",

Step 3: If the parent has only one son and Priya exists, Priya could be the daughter or the man could be Priya if male. Step 4: Since Priya is pointing to the man, they are different people.
