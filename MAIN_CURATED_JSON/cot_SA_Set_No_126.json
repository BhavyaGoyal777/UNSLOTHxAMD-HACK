      "A) P",
      "B) Q",
      "C) R",
      "D) T"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "P is at position 3, Q at position 5. R is at an extreme end, so position 1 or 6. R could be at position 1.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: P is at position 3. Step 2: Q sits second to the right of P, so Q is at position 5. Step 3: R sits at an extreme end, which could be position 1 or 6. Step 4: Testing R at position 1 does not conflict with other seating arrangements. Step 5: Therefore, R could be at position 1.",

    "question": "Five people A, B, C, D, E sit in a circle facing the center. A is to the left of B. C is opposite D. E is between A and D. Who is to the right of C?",
    "choices": [
      "A) A",
      "B) B",
      "C) E",
      "D) D"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "With A left of B, C opposite D, and E between A and D, the circular arrangement forces B to be right of C.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: A is to the left of B. Step 2: C is opposite D. Step 3: E is between A and D. Step 4: In a 5-person circle, opposite means two positions apart. Step 5: Placing all constraints, B must be adjacent to C, making B the right of C.",
