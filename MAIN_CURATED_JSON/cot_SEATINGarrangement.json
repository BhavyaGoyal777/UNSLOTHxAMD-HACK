    "explanation": "With A to the left of B, C opposite D, and E between A and D, the circular arrangement forces B to be to the right of C.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: A is to the left of B. Step 2: C is opposite D. Step 3: E is between A and D. Step 4: In a 5-person circle, opposite means two to three positions apart. Step 5: Placing all constraints, B must be adjacent to C, making B to the right of C.",
