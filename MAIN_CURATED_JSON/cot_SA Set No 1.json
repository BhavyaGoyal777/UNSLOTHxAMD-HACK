      "C) R",
      "D) T"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "P is at position 3, Q at position 5. R is at an extreme end, so position 1 or 6. R could be at position 1.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: P is at position 3. Step 2: Q sits second to the right of P, so Q is at position 5. Step 3: R sits at an extreme end, which could be position 1 or 6. Step 4: Testing if R can be at position 1, there are no conflicts with other constraints. Step 5: Therefore, R at position 1 is valid.",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "With A left of B, C opposite D, and E between A and D, the circular arrangement forces B to be right of C.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: A is left of B. Step 2: C is opposite D. Step 3: E is between A and D. Step 4: In a 5-person circle, opposite means 2-3 positions apart. Step 5: Placing all constraints, B must be adjacent to C, making B the right of C.",
