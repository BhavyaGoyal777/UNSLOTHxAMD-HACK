    "question": "Eight people P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, and Z are sitting around a circle facing the center. T is 2nd to the right of R, who is 3rd to the right of P. S is 2nd to the left of P and 4th to the right of Q. Z is 3rd to the right of V, who is not an immediate neighbor of P. In which combination is the first person sitting between the second and third?",

      "C) ORV",
      "D) PWQ"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "V is sitting between R and T in the clockwise direction.",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Determine the seating arrangement based on given constraints. Step 2: Identify positions of each person. Step 3: Check each combination to see if the first person is between the second and third. Step 4: Verify that V is between R and T. Step 5: Confirm the correct combination is VRT.",
